## Final Conclusion
To drive Blinkit's sales further, the company should focus on expanding its presence through larger outlets, which are already the major revenue contributors. Emphasizing top-performing product categories like Fruits and Vegetables and Snack Foods in marketing campaigns will resonate with customersâ€™ preferences. Additionally, leveraging the strong performance of Supermarket Type 1 with enhanced customer experiences and targeted promotions will help sustain and accelerate revenue growth.
